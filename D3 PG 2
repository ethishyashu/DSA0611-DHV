# 1. Relationship between stock price, volume traded, and market capitalization
# Stock price generally responds to changes in both volume traded and market cap.
# Higher trading volumes can indicate increased investor interest, potentially affecting stock price.
# Market capitalization is directly related to stock price through the number of shares outstanding.

# 2. Create 3D Scatter Plot
scatterplot3d(volume_traded, market_cap, stock_price, 
              main = "Relationship between Volume Traded, Market Cap, and Stock Price",

# 3. Identify Clustering or Outliers (Visual Inspection)
# In the 3D plot, look for any groups of points closely packed together (clustering) or points significantly distant from others (outliers).

# 4. Generate 3D Surface Plot
# Prepare data for surface plot
x <- volume_traded
y <- stock_price
z <- market_cap

# Create a grid of x and y values
xgrid <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 20)
ygrid <- seq(min(y), max(y), length.out = 20)

                      yo = ygrid, 
                      duplicate = "mean")

# Extract the z values as a matrix
zgrid <- interp_data$z
zmatrix <- matrix(zgrid, nrow = length(xgrid), ncol = length(ygrid), byrow = TRUE)

# Create surface plot

# 5. Compare 3D Plots
# Plot stock price against volume traded separately
